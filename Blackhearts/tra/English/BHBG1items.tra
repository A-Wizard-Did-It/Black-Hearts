@22=~Humanbane Bastard Sword~
@23=~Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. 

This old, beaten up sword has been given a bane enchantment, making it particularly effective in slaying humans. Blood seems to permanently stain its chipped blade. Even just holding such a weapon is often considered a sign of the wielder's wickedness, but practicality and virtue are rarely easy companions.

Near as you can tell, the rest of the book is mostly composed of the rantings of a madman; scared witless about some sort of accountant from a former cult of his who was intent on murdering him.

@35=~Tome of Manuscripts~
@36=~This tome contains the manuscripts of the playwright (and rumored Harper) Salena Fairsky, including such popular plays as "The Merryweather Conundrum" and "Whisper the Six". 

Salena's plays are well known for being beautifully written with characters that explore cyclical themes of humanoid-nature. Critics however have often panned her work for being overwrought and with a reliance on deus ex machina endings to resolve central conflicts in the play.

The last few pages contain Salena's last unfinished play, titled "Black Heart". It details a woman named the “Cardinal” as she courts "The Pale Man", who had murdered her family when she was only a child, in the hopes of using the relationship to destroy him. The play seemed to be moving for a tragic turn as the Cardinal's efforts draw her down a dark path, her actions becoming more extreme and compromising her morals little by little until she became just like the man she so hated. The story abruptly stops without any hint for where the ending might have gone.~

Status Report - We've continued to monitor the situation in Baldur's Gate closely. I believe your suspicions about something major happening here were not unfounded. The Iron Throne continues to manipulate the region and consolidate their power. It would be wise to establish a partnership with them now, they seem like the type that would happily pay good coin for our services.

We’ve also spied a Red Wizard enclave in the midst of the city. We believe that they’re aligned with the Iron Throne, although as you’ve said, intel states that there’s no formalized relationship between the two entities. From our own investigations, the Red Wizards here are led by a woman named Cherise, a woman with a curious history from our findings. She is among the old order of cultists, like many that we’ve been ordered to eliminate from our client in the region. It could be tricky if we’re asked to assassinate her, and I will of course defer to your judgment on if we should proceed or not.

As an addition to this status report, we now hold in our possession a Harper agent we were informed would be snooping around. It’s frustrating that we were instructed to hold her in good health when extracting her Harper secrets could be so much more amusing. I can tell you, I dislike working for a client who has more secrets than we do. With that said, we are close to a breakthrough on that as well. Soon we’ll have their ident-

@92=~Borrowed Fortune~
@93=~Loyle Nosbrun was a prodigious gambler, a man who never left home without making a wager, and never returned home without making two more. While such a lifestyle is surely a path to disaster for most, Loyle always found a way out or an unexpected turn of fortune that settled his debts so he could live to gamble another day. Some attributed this unnatural luck to the gaudy sword he wore at his hip, one which he never seemed to be without. 

However, even Loyle’s good luck soon wore thin as he found himself in a criminal’s den, running up a debt that spiraled out of his control. Speaking with the Crime Lord at the center of the ring, Loyle made one last wager, a single unfavored die roll that would either clear his debts, or enslave himself forever to the Crime Lord’s whims. Taking up his sword and laying a kiss on its blade, he rolled the die, which improbably landed in his favor. With a sigh of relief, Loyle left the criminal den. Moments after stepping out, he was improbably crushed by a cow that had fallen loose of the talons of a wyvern far overhead.

When you pick up the blade, you feel your luck greatly improving. However, you also feel a slight undercurrent of dread, sensing that this improvement is not being given, but rather just borrowed from the future. All fortunes balance out in time.

It's difficult to say what the original enchantment placed on the mace was, yet its time within the mimics digestive system seems to have imbued it with properties of the mimic itself. When swung at an enemy, this mace has a chance to ensnare them in the mimic's adhesive ichor or drench them in a mimic's acidic digestive fluids. While a powerful weapon, the Mimic Mace's properties also make it extremely difficult to let go of once picked up, covering the carrier's hand in its sticky coating.

@146=~Gift of Silence~
@147=~The story of Song and Silence is one told often in the taverns of far away Kara-Tur. The story begins with two twin brothers, born on the border between two lands, one of Light and one of Shadow. Each brother was born with a curious affliction. One brother could only speak in verse and song, and every step or sound they made seemed to accompany a strange melody. The other brother was cursed to silence, never able to speak and whose every step seemed muffled and distant. 

Leaders from the prevailing monasteries on both lands came to the family of the destined brothers. There, they agreed to each take a brother, the Brother of Song to the Monastery of Light and the Brother of Silence to the Monastery of Shadow. There, each brother was raised in accordance with their Monastery’s tenants, each becoming a Monk of their associated order.

The brothers did not meet again until a grand martial arts tournament when both entered as representatives of their Monasteries and faced one another. Stories of what happened here diverge greatly. Some describe the brothers fighting to a standstill until they came to embrace one another. Others say they each struck a mortal blow to the other and died together as one. 

The Brother of Silence was crafted this special Ninjatō by his order that was instilled with his virtues. When wielded, the weapon shrouds its wielder in silence, rendering them mute and muffling every sound they make. Those it strikes are enshrouded in the very same silence.

Additionally, its wearer always feels a tingle in the tips of their fingers and their small hairs are always standing on edge.

As strange as their make is, what’s even stranger is the effect they have when worn. The robes have a powerful magnetic field around them. This effect repulses all weapon attacks, but especially projectiles. The material of the robes to slide through the air as if lacking any kind of resistance to it at all. Finally, the magnetic aura also seems to amplify the effects of electricity around them.

In seeking to meld both offense and defense, she created the perfect fusion of both, a shield that provided excellent protection while also spurning the user onwards. Unlike other shields that benefit from a slower approach to battle, the Tempest Targe is meant to be wielded much like a weapon in the off-hand, repelling attacks in one moment while striking enemies the other. The effect is much akin to dual wielding weapons, although with the added protection of a shield in the off-hand.

@165=~Decoded Diary of Riezen Darkeyes~
@10001=~*Translator’s note: I’ve gone through and transcribed the most important entries in the volume. Hope this helps, or that you at least find it interesting.

Entry 1 - The Harper leadership has convened and assigned to me the pursuit of a woman who has been seen in the company of several known Bhaalspawn. It’s a most confidential mission. I’m not to speak of it to anyone, and should not even be leaving a written record of my task. I only do so under the most carefully devised code that only I or other high ranking Harpers should be able to decipher in the worst case that I cannot accomplish my mission or report back.

Entry 6 - I have located my target and begun to trail her. She does not yet know I follow her. However, she has proceeded into the Underdark for some reason I cannot guess at. This is troubling, yet I will continue my task and track her beneath. I only hope that I do not encounter my darkened bastard kin there. 

Entry 9 - I’ve followed my target for days beneath the earth. Or... perhaps weeks? Time escapes me here. Her destination has revealed itself. She has come to a small shrine, away from the major drow cities. However, the shrine is tended to by other drow. The complex has the markings of Bhaal on them... likely they hide from the Lloth worshiping drow who would destroy a shrine to any surface deity, even one as foul as theirs. She remains in the shrine tending to a young drow woman, I believe educating her. She cannot long be an adult now. She is... rather lovely, despite her dark heritage. 

Entry 13 - I’ve claimed a large cavern in the Underdark as my residence while I observe my target and her dark prodigy. The mushrooms I tend to and wildlife are adequate to sustain me. I miss the sun, but not so terribly as some of my kin might. I’ve always felt an attraction to the shaded recesses of the below ground. Tending to my mushroom groves, I’ve begun to find new respect for my dark kin.

Entry 18 - I’ve made a terrible error. While I was tending to my groves, I was intruded upon. But while I feared that the vile drow may have discovered me, it was only the single drow girl that my target has been tutoring. I know now why. She is a child of the dark god. A Bhaalspawn. Is it our duty as the Harpers to protect such beings? She’s so beautiful and curious. She did not hate me when she found me. She wished to talk. She even promised not to reveal me to her kin.

Entry 19 - She has begun to visit me regularly. Her name is Sendai. I think I love her. 

Entry 22 - My target left the enclave some time ago, but I did not follow. I cannot follow. Perhaps this is an abdication of my mission, but I feel like I must remain here with Sendai. She tells me of her plans, the things she was born to achieve. It scares me because, more and more, I think she speaks truly. I wish for her the destiny she speaks of. 

Entry 29 - This will be my last entry. I have sworn myself to Sendai with all my heart. She sends me on a mission topside... I must destroy an enemy of hers. A Bhaalspawn like her who would ascend before her own plans fall into place. None may steal this inheritance from my love. The Harpers be damned.~

@6090=~<CHARNAME>

I hope this message finds you, though if you're chasing the Crusade like I expect you are, my messenger probably just needs to stand in the warpath and wait. 

It's fortunate that you're headed up this way. Nearby to where Bhaal was slain on Boareskyr Bridge is a Harper compound, one that holds the single largest repository of knowledge on him and his legacy, as far as I know. While normally Harpers don't exactly allow outsiders to trawl through their records, I've convinced a few people to turn the other way for a bit. I'm sure you have all kinds of questions about your legacy or what it means, and maybe you'll find something here to help. If you can spare a day's walk from Dragonspear, at the edge of the Trollbark Forest you can find Besequein Manor house. Present in this letter are more detailed instructions as well as an invitation you can present to the guards. 

I'll be waiting for you there. Travel safe out there.

You sense that while such a book would have an unholy presence in the past, Bhaal's death has left it in a diminished state, no more foul than the text and diagrams within.

A quick scan through reveals that many of the pages deeper in the book seem odd. There are stains of blood all over the pages, yet they contain no text that you can see. Even still, they seem important. Perhaps someone more familiar with the rites of Bhaal will know what to do with them.~

@6268=~Vivisectionist Blade~
@6269=~While many of Bhaal's cult believed that their lord cared little for how one suffered before death, only that it was the moment of their death that honored their lord, others believed that Bhaal admired the art of drawing out those last moments to exquisite suffering. The Vivisectionist's Blade was a tool carried by the higher priests of Bhaal committed to this philosophy, its razor shape honed specifically not to kill quickly, but to flense off pieces of their sacrifices bit by bit. The result is a fearsome weapon even when wielded away from the vivisectionist's table.

@6272=~To the one who killed me,

You're probably reading this looking to see if I had given you a nice simply synopsis of my thoughts and feelings, maybe what brought me to this point. Maybe this could have been useful to you, or maybe you just wanted to gloat on how you stopped me.

I refuse to give you that satisfaction. My hatred for you will continue past my death. I will be there for your every failure, your every misfortune and loss. And I will be laughing at you.

I curse you. May your limbs wither away and your senses flee you. May you be abandoned by everyone who was ever dear to you, and be left to live as a forgotten, unloved husk. You don't deserve it. I didn't, and you deserve even less.

Bastard. Do you think I'm petty? Maybe I am. I don't care. Nothing matters, none of it.

PS: If you're not the one who killed me, well, I mean this for you too anyway.~

@6531=~Stiletto of Shifting Light~
@6532=~Light never seems to quite reflect cleanly the blade of this dagger, always instead being caught and bent in strange angles. This makes any reflections that come from it appear twisted and warped. Such daggers are most common among illusionist assassins who utilize their spells to get in close to a target and strike, then to use the confusion from their spells to allow them to escape. 

This particular dagger weaves a combination of two such spells that activates when struck. The first causes the refracted light around them to form an identical illusory copy nearby, while the second renders them invisible from sight.

@6533=~Remembrance~
@6534=~This metallic staff is capped with a large sapphire gem that shines in a short radius around it. It was the craft of an oddly forgetful wizard who became frustrated when he would misremember the very spells he had spent all night studying the next morning. Onlookers questioned little why the wizard had a slippery memory however, as he was prone to knocking himself on the head with his own staff during moments of frustration. His enchantment at least let such self-punitive quirks undo as much harm as they did, though it often left him forgetting one spell as he remembered another. 

He eventually passed on his staff to a priest of Tempus who was a dear friend of his in his later years. She discovered that using the staff to clobber the heads of monsters did the trick far better than smacking one's own.

@6734=~Time of Troubles - Doom of Assassins~
@6735=~Eleasis 13 1358 DR

Bane and Myrkul prepared for an assault on the city of Tantras, in which the god Torm guarded over one of the Tablets of Fate with his most valorous disciplines. As the forces of Zhentil Keep marched towards the city on the coast of the Dragon Reach, Bane and Myrkul devised a terrible plan. Nearby, a great golem made of black glass, forged in the Hells themselves and called the Black Brother, had been planted by Bane long ago. Through ancient ritual it could be animated and inhabited by Bane's Avatar, and with its awesome power he could destroy the city and its guardians, including Torm himself, and take back the Tablet of Fate. 

However, to empower the golem required an immense well of souls to draw from, souls of darkness that aligned with Bane's own evil. It so happened that Bane had a ready well of such a souls to draw from. Nearby, Myrkul's dark priests prepared a spell of death on a mass-scale, perhaps the greatest of such spells ever conceived. Through means unknown, Bane and Myrkul had obtained the True Names of all assassins of Faerûn. Knowing their true names, the spell of mass death killed every assassin while Bane's own priests performed the Stealing of Souls ritual to harness their dark life force and channel it into the Black Brother. And so Bane rose with terrible power, and his ensuing battle with Torm remains perhaps the most remarkable of the Time of Troubles.

One less remarked on matter of this incident was how the death of so many assassins directly undermined Bhaal's own power on Faerûn. As the god of murder and assassinations, the rituals eliminated nearly every true follower of Bhaal through the realms, and rendered Bhaal's avatar a hollow shell of the power he once was, a power so easily dispatched by Cyric the mortal.~
@6736=~Mission Report: Temple Raid~
@6737=~Sir,

I report to inform you that the mission was a success. We breached into the temple swiftly, dispatching the guards without a sound in the night. It appears that our information was correct. We found them gathering the children in pens, like chattel to slaughter. Children of dark heritage they may have been, but innocent all the same. We rushed to save all the children we could.

The ensuing melee was chaos, yet the ambush was well prepared and we fell upon the cultists and cut through them like Selune's light cutting through dark. We were able to fell most of their order without too many losses on our own side, however I regret to inform that Arryn and Pearla were casualties of the battle. A few other injured, but they will recover. 

The chaos allowed the children to flee. This proved a double edged blade. While they are no longer in imminent danger, we have been unable to locate most. We will return with those we were able to secure shortly. We must call our scouts to find the others as soon as possible, I worry what might happen if they fall into the wrong hands.~
@6738=~Ecological Report: Winding Water~
@6739=~After much testing, it seems that the Winding Water may be irrevocably tainted by the dark god's blood. The effects have proved subtle, yet noticeable by the druidic sects surrounding the river. The water itself runs darker than usual. Animals generally refuse to drink from it, and plants that grow nearby do so in twisted brambles. While we've found that the water is not immediately toxic to drink, in large quantities it will cause sickness and eventually death. Several Talonites have been found to be experimenting with the waters, no doubt trying to create more wicked poisons from its contamination. 

A number of druids are doing what they can to cleanse the waters, but this work is expected to take years, if not generations. There has been one other curious matter of note... those rare cultists of Bhaal that still exist seem to draw some divine power from the waters themselves. Perhaps some essence of Bhaal's divinity still exists within the river.

*Note: It has been tested that the divine residue contained within the waters extends only as far out as half a day's travel on horseback. However, I theorize a higher concentration of the taint within the water might be able to be carried out, and perhaps that could provide a direct link back to the source.~

@6744=~Memo on Known Bhaalspawn~
@6745=~We've attempted to track what Bhaalspawn we can but those efforts have proven difficult. That difficulty is of course complicated by our the need for secrecy within our own organization. Remember that Bhaalspawn pose a unique danger and so everything has been done to obfuscate their whereabouts. Even within our leadership, no one Harper is aware of more than one or two of them. Those that were known have been arranged to live ordinary lives of no importance so as to be beneath the notice of those who might seek to use them in some gambit to bring back their Lord Father. By living boring normal lives, perhaps they will escape the chaotic fate that prophecy has dictated of them.

We must be committed to the prevention of Alaundo's prophecy by any means we can. While some believe we must take a more active role, Elminster believes that acting with ignorance is worse than not acting at all, and we still know so little. If you come unto the identity of any of them, reveal it to no one else and do not risk drawing attention to them by attempting to make contact. We who Harp must always exercise discretion on when to sing, and when to stay silent.~
@6746=~The Rise of the Black Sun~
@6747=~It was a ruinous providence indeed that the mortal Cyric ascended with not just one portfolio from the Dead Three in his grasp, but all three. He did not rest on his laurels. Those who had worshipped Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul previously rushed to swear themselves to the Black Sun, for how could they resist the power of this new god, who embodied everything their old masters had and so much more? Those who remained obstinate in their old allegiances were predictably given no mercy, snuffed away in their old houses of worship.  

Cyric has since been proactive with stamping out remnants of the old gods of his domains. Mausoleums dedicated to Myrkul have been defaced and icons to the Black Sun put in their place. The old iron edifices of Bane's rule have been knocked on their side and turned to madhouses. In those hidden altars of bloody sacrifice, Bhaal's serrated daggers have been replaced with skull laden shortblades more suitable to Cyric. 

What then of the progeny of Bane and Bhaal who still remain? 

Cyric has been curiously restrained with either. Iyachtu Xvim still remains missing, and perhaps Cyric is behind whatever banishment the progeny of Bane is under. Cyric is similarly uninvolved with the Bhaalspawn, giving no direction to his followers in regards to them at all. Would he not wish these last remnants stamped out with the same fervor as Bhaal's cults and temples? So far, the answer seems to be not. Perhaps then he watches from afar, waiting to see how their development can be turned to his own advantage.~
@6748=~A Reexamination of Alaundo's Prophecy~
@6749=~There have been many interpretations of Alaundo's prophecy regarding the Bhaalspawn throughout the years. Most scholars agree that the great machinations of Bhaal were some intention for his sired offspring to bring about his revival, confirmed by other less eminent prophets. In light of new information, we must re-examine the prophecy and decipher just how the mechanism of Bhaal's return is intended.

The answer would seem obvious at first. The Lord of Murder's rebirth must certainly be by murder itself? Yet this presents a question. Are his children intended to be murdered to bring about his return, or are they intended to accrue murders of their own that might emulate their father? Or both?

In our recent raid on the temple, it seemed that the cultists of Bhaal intended to put all Bhaalspawn they had gathered to the blade as soon as Bhaal had been destroyed. Yet this violates the prophecy in one key way: it states that the Bhaal children would be the source of chaos, that it would come from their passage. Perhaps then the Cult had selected one or a few children among the score to nurture, while the others would be fed to the sacrificial blade to give them strength. Yet even this seems wrong, for the prophecy refers to numerous Spawn who would be the source of chaos, and not only a few. Did the Cult get it wrong? Of all the Bhaal priests we have interrogated, none seem to have been given a full view of the exact mechanism that would bring about the revival of their Lord. In fact, the High Priest was the one tasked with conducting the rites, yet she seems to have died in the great culling from the ritual in Tantras.

Should we assume Alaundo himself was mistaken? Or is there a missing variable not yet known? A break in the link between Bhaal and his followers that has caused such a confused response to his plans? Candlekeep will be a suitable place to continue my study. And I think to raise my new charges as well.

@6750=~Dossier: Amelyssan the Blackhearted~
@6751=~Race: Human
Birth: Estimated 1330
Skin: Fair
Hair: Auburn, often colored deeper red
Eyes: Blue
Other Defining Features: Observed to adorn herself in Dove feathers streaked with blood.
Rank: High Deathstalker
Death: 1357 (recorded)

There is exceedingly little information available about the Last High Deathstalker of Bhaal, known as Amelyssan the Blackhearted. Her involvement in the Cult of Bhaal must have come early in life, as she ascended to the position of High Deathstalker at a remarkably young age. While most of Bhaal's followers believe that their Lord preferred obvious and bloody displays from victims, Amelyssan was known for cold calculation and talent at manipulation and intrigue. Few direct murders have been associated with her, yet her presence was observed in the leadup to the Tethyrian Interregnum, and she's suspected to have been the primary mastermind in directing the chaos that caused the Ten Black Days of Eleint, one of the bloodiest periods of history in Faerûn. Her role in other incidents of extreme civil unrest and bloodshed is suspected, but not confirmed. 

It is only known that she was well favored by her god, and her word commanded any assassin she beheld who had ever uttered so much as a prayer to the Lord of Murder. 

Amelyssan was last reported operating within the Dragon Reach during the Time of Troubles. A body roughly matching her description and which held objects that proved her status as High Priest was located not far outside the city. It was drained in the same manner as all other assassins were in the great culling that was conducted by Bane and Myrkul. Her dossier has been closed and archived.~
@6752=~Report - Bhaalspawn Movement~
@6753=~My Lord,

I know that we're supposed to remain hands off with monitoring the Bhaalspawn, but I swear that something is transpiring that is of deepest concern. I have separately reached out to many colleagues and they each report that the Bhaalspawn they were aware of have all begun to migrate to the south and west. Two of these colleagues have now gone missing after deciding to investigate further and speak to their charges directly. 

I tell you, some force is compelling the Bhaalspawn to gather and any who dig deep are met with grisly fate. Could this be the sign? Do we stand on the verge of the chaos that Alaundo prophesized? Can we really afford to remain so inactive when danger looms so near?~
@7014=~Prophecy Translation~
@6754=~During the days of the Avatars, the Lord of Murder will spawn a score of mortal progeny. These offspring will be aligned good and evil, but chaos will flow through them all. When the Beast's bastard children come of age, they will bring havoc to the lands of the Sword Coast. One of these children must rise above the rest and claim their father's legacy. This inheritor will shape the history of the Sword Coast for centuries to come.

@6875=~Scouting Report - Strange Statue in Trollbark Woods~
@6876=~We were tracking a pair of what appeared to be identical twins through the Trollbark woods. They proceeded with an odd funerary march that eventually outpaced us, however an hour later we found one of them within a disquieting glade. At the center of the glade a statue of two featureless figures, one with a blade or stick raised, prepared to strike the other who cowered in fear. 

The twin we found was dead at the foot of the statue, his head likely bashed in against it. A check of his inventory revealed iconography that identified him as a adherent to Bhaal. We suspect some ritual was conducted to emulate the scene within the statue. However the statue itself contained no indication it was made for any ritual purpose to Bhaal himself. No, this seems to me something far more ancient and primal.

*a set of directions below seems to be partially blotted out by spilled ink*

*Addendum Report: Among every culture from the barbarian tribes of the Spine of the World to the spirit shaman of Rashemen is the story of the first kin killing, that moment when one brother raises their sword against another and commits fratricide. Perhaps this statue is a recreation of that story from an older time.~

Even more valuable however are a twinned set of enchantments that keep their wearer safe; one for speed and one for protection. These ensure that the wearer lives to enjoy another quiet night by the fire with their feet raised high, basking in the comfort of their loafers.

However, the sophistication of the enchantment also extends to rejecting being worn by those whose feet are unsuitably rough and 'peasantly' to appreciate them. As such, more martially inclined folk may find them simply a pair of comfortable if opinionated shoes.

@7137=~<CHARNAME>,

This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Truth is, the wound I suffered from Sarevok was always fatal, I simply had bought a few more months of time. But that time has run out. This glade seems a peaceful enough place to pass. I enjoy the quiet. I've already ingested the poison pill. This is my last message to you.

The Deathbringer ritual is a sham. Or... a ruse perpetuated by the Bhaal Priests to control those who proved themselves the most efficient weapons. Yet I now realize Sarevok never finished the ritual. He was ever his own man. I sought a truth that would easily explain our fall, but the truth has proven to be both elusive as well as clear and plain.

We were undone because you were simply better than us. 

Gloat if you like, I acknowledge your victory, absolute. I've even left you my best pair of shoes as a reward. How kind am I?

Do not let yourself be guided by those who would use you.
