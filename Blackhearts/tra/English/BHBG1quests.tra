@15=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

A rather arrogant bounty hunter named Illasera has offered to subcontract her bounties to me. A strange offer, but it could be a lucrative endeavor. My first targets are a band of would-be adventurers who got too deep into their cups and killed a local. I'm told they fled east. If I need more information, maybe someone in the Burning Wizard would know more.~

@20=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

I've completed my first bounty for Illasera and received another. A troop of hobgoblins called the Redwater Raiders is terrorizing the Coast Road south of Beregost. I need to first locate where they are operating from, take them out, and retrieve their leader's sword as proof. Maybe a caravan worker in Beregost might know more.~

@25=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

My next target is a necromancer by the name of Sazazir who has taken residence in the Nashkel Mines. It's far too soon since I was there last, I'm not looking forward to delving in those lightless depths yet again.~

@28=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

It seems that this job has me now hunting down book thiefs. This one is an Ogre Mage, accosting travelers outside of Candlekeep. While he's causing quite a lot of trouble, he hasn't actually attacked anyone yet. Perhaps it would be worth speaking to him first.~

@39=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

My next contract has me traveling north of Beregost to the Crossroads between it and the Friendly Arm. It seems that a group of mercenaries has stolen a relic that was bound for a collector and likely still resides in the area. I need to take the relic back to Illasera, and dispose of the mercenaries if possible.~

@65=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Illasera no longer has any more contracts for me to carry out. She said that she's headed north. I have little doubt that I will be running into her in the future.~

@70=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

I met with Illasera again in Baldur's Gate. She introduced me to a defecting Red Wizard involved in the conspiracy that has taken the Sword Coast. However, just before he was about to divulge what he knew, the man was assassinated. I need to find this assassin and figure out what's going on here.~

@74=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

We learned the name of our would-be assassin, one Riezen Darkeyes, a Harper. I didn't think Harpers did anything like this though! Just as we learned this fact though, we were ambushed by a pack of Ankhegs. Most unusual behavior for Ankhegs, and too much coincidence to assume this is anything other than another attempt to assassinate us. We need to locate this Riezen soon.~

@75=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Our next lead is a Harper woman by the name of Nerys. Our best hope is that she might have a lead as to the location of this Harper assassin, Riezen Darkeyes. She may be found in the Three Old Kegs inn in northern Baldur's Gate.~

@77=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Our next location is a hidden gorge to the north of Baldur's Gate, past the farmlands there. If Riezen is anywhere, he's likely there. I need to know what he knows about the Red Wizard conspiracy in the city and why he's trying to kill me.~

@87=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Riezen had little information to give us, but it looks like the Harper Nerys may have come through yet with some details of the Red Wizard plot. We're to meet her outside the Drakon Tavern after nightfall, near the gate into the interior wall of the city.~

@88=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Nerys has been kidnapped! It seems that her poking about the Red Wizards business has attracted the eyes of the Night Knives, who have taken her hostage. They're threatening to kill her if I do not stop my investigation into the Red Wizard plot. Perhaps Illasera might have some suggestions of where to go from here.~

@105=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

We've rescued Nerys and she informed us of the location that the Red Wizards are operating from, as well as the pass phrase to get in. It is down in the sewers to the southeast part of the city, through a tunnel that trails off to the southwest. She mentioned the fastest way to get there was a grate by the Blade and Stars tavern. It's time to deal with these Red Wizards, before they can aid the schemes of the Iron Throne.~

@107=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

We confronted Cherise Siltuhr in the Red Wizard's lair, but she fled after learning that some extradimensional domain of theirs was being attacked at the same time as I confronted them. It's too much of a coincidence not to suspect this is Illasera's doing. I should try to find her as soon as I can, hopefully back at the Elfsong tavern.~

@114=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

We met Illasera back at the Elfsong tavern. She revealed that she was the one who had drawn Cherise away from us, attacking an extra-dimensional safehold that the Red Wizards were storing their creatures in. While Illasera was unsuccessful in defeating her, she claims to have disrupted her plans. It seems I will have to wait a bit longer to follow this thread further. In the meantime, I still have the Iron Throne to investigate...~

@123=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

We encountered Illasera again in the Underceller. With Sarevok's plan coming to a head, we don't have much time left to disrupt the plan of his ally, Cherise Siltuhr. Illasera has offered to send us into her pocket dimension domain, but we'll need to make sure we're prepared for what might be many difficult battles, as her menagerie now roams free.~

@124=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Illasera has sent us into the pocket dimension that serves as Cherise Siltuhr's domain. We need to acclimate to this strange environment and discover a route to her, fighting through the numerous creatures in her menagerie that roam free. We will only be able to return once we've confronted Cherise and defeated her.~

@133=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

Krotia the Black has told us that in order to breach the sanctum of Cherise Siltuhr, we must bring to the foot of the Sanctum four magical gemstones. They were given to Cherise's servants to attempt to regain control over the astral domain, so may be found around the Astral plane here.~

@152=~Black Hearts - The Huntress

I've killed Cherise and taken away another important ally from Sarevok. Ilasera stayed behind to secure her demiplane. I get the feeling I will be seeing her again, though who knows when.~

@6116=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I encountered Tamoko on the road to Boareskyr Bridge. She has requested that I journey to a secret temple of Bhaal to follow in Sarevok's footsteps, and find anything I can related to his ascendence as something called a "Deathbringer". She seems to believe this will illuminate my own heritage.~

@6138=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I encountered Winski Perorate on the road to Boareskyr Bridge. He has requested that I journey to a secret temple of Bhaal to follow in Sarevok's footsteps, and find anything I can related to his ascendence as something called a "Deathbringer". He seems to believe this will illuminate my own heritage.~

@6330=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I recovered a profane book of Bhaalist rituals from the temple and gave it over to Tamoko to be examined. She may need some time to study it before any deeper insights are revealed however.~

@6341=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

Without anything to show for my time in the Bhaalish temple, the quest to further my knowledge of legacy of Sarevok and Bhaal has come to a close.~

@6460=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I received a letter from Nerys that has given me an invitation to a Harper hideout which she believes contains records and documents crucial to learning more about my birthright. It is a few days journey from the Coalition camp, but I should have time to travel there as the Camp establishes itself.~

@6461=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

Tamoko's study of the Bhaalist ritual book has uncovered a cavern where his priests attempted to collect his blood and essence that leaked into the Winding Water after his death. This could be a dangerous development, or a potential opportunity? I have the location marked on the map, so I should take time out from the Crusade to visit this cave.~

This could be a dangerous development, or a potential opportunity? I have the location marked on the map, so I should take time out from the Crusade to visit this cave.~

@6571=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I found a mass of misshapen flesh that formed from the Bhaal's congealed blood that leaked into the Winding Water after his death. I decided to do nothing, and left it the way I found it.~

@6593=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I found a mass of misshapen flesh that formed from the Bhaal's congealed blood that leaked into the Winding Water after his death. I decided to take what was left of his essence to empower myself, though it seems to have come with a cost.~

@6594=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I found a mass of misshapen flesh that formed from the Bhaal's congealed blood that leaked into the Winding Water after his death. I decided to purge it with fire, which will hopefully free the tainted Winding Water of its curse in time.~

@6968=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

Tamoko and I visted the Harper Archive and exhausted every book and note that we could find regarding Bhaal. I'm not sure if what we found was really all that useful, but Tamoko thinks that there might still be some clues between the details that is important.~

@7013=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

Winski and I visted the Harper Archive and exhausted every book and note that we could find regarding Bhaal. I'm not sure if what we found was really all that useful and Winksi seemed pessimistic. Perhaps something will come of it.~

@7016=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I visted the Harper Archive and exhausted every book and note that I could find regarding Bhaal. I'm not sure if what I found was really all that useful, though maybe having a wider view of the particulars of the prophecy will matter later.~

@7140=~Black Hearts - Pilgrimage

I've reached the kinkiller glade, which seems to have been the last location Sarevok went to up north before he returned south to Baldur's Gate. In the phantom visions, I saw him turn away the Red Woman's gifts and set on his own path. As monstrous as that path was, I wonder if it could have been worse? Who was this woman, and what's her interest in the Bhaalspawn?~
